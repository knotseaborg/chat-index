# ðŸ§­ Chat Navigator â€” Branching Memory System for AI Conversations

A proof-of-concept (POC) system that reimagines how long-form chat conversations can be **navigated**, **branched**, and **summarized** to support exploratory thinking and idea evolution.

---

## ðŸŒŒ What Is It?

Most chat UIs are linear, throwaway, and context-heavy. This tool changes that.

> âœ¦ **Chat Navigator** is a chat augmentation system that:
> - Tracks every message as a node in a tree
> - Detects topic shifts and generates summaries
> - Allows **branching off** from any point in the conversation
> - Supports **subtree pruning**, merging, and reindexing
> - Builds a flat, fast, UI-optimized **chat + summary trace map**

It's not just a chatbot UI. It's a **cognitive branching system**.

## ðŸ’¡ Use Case

For engineers, researchers, strategists, and thinkers who want to:

- Experiment with alternate solutions without biasing the LLM
- Review idea evolution over long sessions
- Prune and restructure their conversations like code
- Summarize or "collapse" sections of discussion into digestible chunks

---

## ðŸ§± Architecture

- **Backend**: Python, SQLAlchemy, FastAPI
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI / LangChain
- **Core Data Models**:
  - `messages`: flat list with parent/child linkage
  - `summaries`: spans with start/end nodes, summary tree projection
- **Tree Structures**:
  - `message_index`: message tree built from link table
  - `summary_index`: tree of summaries projected over message graph
- **Dispatcher Pattern**: All mutations (add, branch, delete, summarize) routed through typed handlers

---

## âœ¨ Key Features

- âœ… Add message (user or AI)
- âœ… Detect topic shift â†’ auto-generate summary
- âœ… Branch from any message and isolate new line of thought
- âœ… Delete branch (subtree deletion)
- âœ… Summarize unsummarized segments
- ðŸ§ª Experimental: merge and split summaries

---

## ðŸ§ª Status

This is a work-in-progress, backend-first POC.

- Frontend is minimal or stubbed (planned for completion post-Golden Week)
- Summary merging, UI navigation, and full reindexing support are under design
- Designed with long-term extensibility, versioning, and visual traceability in mind

## ðŸ”­ Future Vision

Imagine Git, but for AI conversations â€” a system where you don't just *chat*...

> You explore.  
> You branch.  
> You trace your thoughts across time.

Open a discussion or issue â€” especially if you're interested in:

- React/JS frontend integration
- Context-aware pruning or UI-driven summarization
- Git-style diffing and merging of conversation branches
