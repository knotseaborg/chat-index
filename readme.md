# ðŸ§­ Chat Navigator â€” Branching Memory System for AI Conversations

A proof-of-concept (POC) system that reimagines how long-form chat conversations can be **navigated**, **branched**, and **summarized** to support exploratory thinking and idea evolution.

---

## ðŸŒŒ What Is It?

Most chat UIs are linear, throwaway, and context-heavy. This tool changes that.

> âœ¦ **Chat Navigator** is a chat augmentation system that:
> - Tracks every message as a node in a tree
> - Detects topic shifts and generates summaries
> - Allows **branching off** from any point in the conversation
> - Supports **subtree pruning** and reindexing
> - Builds a flat, fast, UI-optimized **chat + summary trace map**

It's not just a chatbot UI. It's a **cognitive branching system**.

## ðŸ’¡ Use Case

For engineers, researchers, strategists, and thinkers who want to:

- Experiment with alternate solutions without biasing the LLM
- Navigate and Review idea evolution over long sessions
- Prune and restructure their conversations like code
- Summarize or "collapse" sections of discussion into digestible chunks

---

## ðŸ§ª Status

This is a work-in-progress, backend-first POC.

- Frontend is yet to be developed.
- Summary merging, UI navigation, and full reindexing support are under design
- Designed with long-term extensibility, versioning, and visual traceability in mind

---

## ðŸ”­ Future Vision

Imagine Git, but for AI conversations â€” a system where you don't just *chat*...

> You explore.  
> You branch.  
> You trace your thoughts across time.
